Then I get dressed.
And what do you normally
have for breakfast

Saturday.
On Thursday evening,

He`s one of our newsreaders...
And he`s a very good newsreader,
isn`t he
Gary! You...
Hey. It`s only a joke, Rebecca.
Well, I don`t think it`s funny.
Now, I always come on at
the end of the programme...
...and try the food and drinks.
That`s the next bit.
Is everything ready
I think so.
Frederick`s on the phone, Martha.
He`s in New York.
OK. Five minutes then, Julia.

OK. What would you like
I`ll have a glass of white wine,

Two glasses of white wine...
...a mineral water with ice and lemon,
and a pint of lager.
- Who`s Ellie
- Tim`s girlfriend.
Oh! Aren`t you Tim`s girlfriend
Me No. Ellie`s my flatmate.
Tim lives upstairs.
Oh, I see. What does she do
She works in a hotel,
so she works funny hours.
Here we are. Nice, cold drinks.
No reply.
- Morning, Tim.
- Morning, Ted.
Oh dear. You look tired.
What time were you up this morning
About four o`clock. There was an
accident at the station.
There weren`t any trains
for five hours.
- Terrible.
- Oh hi, Rebecca.
Hi. Thanks Ted.
What`s the date today, Tim
What
Today`s date. What is it
Er, it`s the fourth of October.
And what do you know
about the fourth of October
It`s the day after the third of October
Try again, Tim.
Think of your girlfriend.
Oh no! It`s Ellie`s birthday.
But I haven`t got her a card or a
present or anything. Excuse me!
Oh, sorry!
Good afternoon, Julia.
I know. I`m sorry.
The trains were all late.
There was an accident at the station.
Is Martha annoyed
Well, she isn`t pleased - this is
the second time this week.
Yes, but it wasn`t my fault today.
And you were late last Thursday, too.
Well, that`s it. I must
find a flat in town.
Are there any places in there
No, there aren`t.
What about this
Second floor flat - bedroom, living
room, small kitchen and bathroom/WC.
Yes, but it`s  £600 a month.
I can`t afford that.
No, I suppose not.
You could try an agency.
I haven`t got time.
Ask Martha for some time off
this afternoon.
Oh come on, Rebecca.
I was late this morning, remember
Well, try it.
Martha`s got a teleconference with
Frederick all afternoon.
A teleconference
Yes. Frederick`s in Tokyo.
Oh, so Martha doesn`t need me.
So let me see -
there`s the room and the kitchen...
...and the bathroom and the toilet are
in the hall.
Yes, that`s right. You share them with
the people upstairs.
They`re very nice people.
And how much is it, Mr Jackson
It`s only  £65 a week.
So are you interested
Yes, definitely.
- The people upstairs
- Uh, yes.
Reception.
Any luck
No. There isn`t anything.
Everything`s too far away, too
expensive, too noisy, or just grotty.
Never mind.
Look. Come to my place for a drink.
It`s a sort of surprise for Ellie`s
birthday.
OK.
Back in a minute.
- This is a nice place, Rebecca.
- Yes, I like it. This is Ellie`s room.
We`ve got this living room, a kitchen
and the bathroom`s down the hall...
...next to my bedroom.
Where do you live, Gary
I`ve got a flat just round the corner.
Gary`s got a lovely place.
It`s on the top floor and
it`s got a great view.
Tea, everyone
There`s a message on your
answerphone.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday, dear Ellie.
Happy birthday to you.
See you later. Love you. Bye.
Love you. Bye. You old romantic.
Well, I think it`s very sweet, Tim.
Hi, Rebecca. It`s me...
Sshh, everybody. It`s Ellie.
Hi, Rebecca. It`s me, Ellie.
This is just to say goodbye.
I`m really sorry about this, but I`ve
got a job in a hotel in San Francisco...
...and so... well... er...
The rent for this month is on the
dressing table in my room.
There`s a letter for Tim there, too.
Can you give it to him, please
So, er... that`s it. Bye. Take care.
- Oh dear. Poor Tim.
- Well, it was very strange.
I mean she wasn`t here last night...
...and then she wasn`t here
this morning and...
Look on the bright side.
You need a new flatmate now.
Julia needs a room, so...
Gary!
It`s all right, Julia. Gary`s right.
The room is yours, if you want it.
- What Really
- Yes, really.
Oh, thank you! That`s great.
Wonderful!
Oh, Tim. I`m sorry.
I`m sorry I`m late, Tim.
I had to go to the police station about
Kylie and Jason. They...
Not now, Sean.
We need to go in five minutes.
What`s the matter with him today
- It`s Ellie.
- Ellie
- She`s gone.
- Gone
- To the States.
- To the States
She left yesterday.
You see, yesterday
was Ellie`s birthday.
Tim, Gary, Julia and I went back to my
place for a birthday drink for Ellie.
Ellie wasn`t there, but there was a
message from her on the answerphone.
She said that she had a new job in San
Francisco and well... goodbye.
What did Tim do
He just walked out of the flat.
He didn`t say a word.
It was all very sad and, well,
embarrassing.
We didn`t know what to do.
No wonder he`s in a bad mood.
But it`s not all bad news, because
Julia`s my new flatmate now.
- Come on, Sean. We haven`t got all day.
- Have a nice day.
There, that`s the lot.
Cup of tea, Mr Drake
Um, no, thank you, Rebecca.
I`d better be off now.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Don`t mention it, love.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye Rebecca.
- Welcome to Wellington Gardens.
- I still can`t believe it.
Why don`t we have a party - a sort of
`Welcome to Julia` thing
Oh, yes. Great idea. When
Next Friday
We can invite some of the neighbours
and everyone from work.
Everyone Even Frederick
Don`t worry. He`s in South Africa
for the rest of the week.
So who can we invite
Oh, what`s this
It`s an invitation to our party.
A party, eh When is it
It`s next Friday. The eighteenth.
Tim, here.
Great! I like parties.
- We can`t come.
- But...
We`ve got that programme to finish.
Can`t we do it another time
It`s Julia`s...
No!
Oh, well...
Hi, Tim. It`s party time.
No, it isn`t.
OK, I think we can take
a look at that now.
Last year Richard Bennett gave up his
job in a London bank...
...and decided to walk
to the South Pole.
Why did you give up your job, Richard
Well, I didn`t like my job and I had a
lot of problems at home.
I just wanted to get away from it all.
I wanted to find myself, if you like.
So you left England in August.
What did you do first
I flew to Buenos Aires in Argentina.
From there I travelled to the
Antarctic by boat.
When did you actually start
your journey to the Pole
Well, I had to wait for a few weeks,
because the weather was very bad...
...so I didn`t set off until the end
of September.
Did anyone go with you
No, I was on my own.
And did you reach the South Pole
No, I didn`t.
After about three hundred kilometres
I fell into a huge crevasse...
...you know - a big hole -
about ten metres deep.
Were you hurt
Yes, I broke my arm.
I couldn`t climb out.
What did you do
Well, fortunately, my sledge
fell into the hole with me...
...so I had food, and I had my radio,
too.
And I called for help.
How long were you there
before they found you
Five days.
There was a bad storm, you see.
I thought it was the end, but then
suddenly I heard voices and dogs.
I shouted and shouted and faces
appeared above me.
What did you think about,
while you were in the crevasse
I thought about my life back in England.
And the funny thing was that all my
problems at home and at work...
...weren`t important any more.
I just wanted to be with my
family and friends again.
Life`s very short, you know.
You have to enjoy it while you can.
Thank you very much.
Can I just look at that last part again
I thought about my life back in England.
And the funny thing was that all my
problems at home and at work...
...weren`t important any more.
I just wanted to be with my family
and friends again.
Life`s very short, you know.
You have to enjoy it while you can.
Thank you very much.
Yes, that`s fine.
Do you want a cup of coffee Tim
Sorry. What did you say
Would you like a coffee
No thanks, Sean. We`ve got
a party to go to.
What do you think, Rebecca
The skirt or the trousers
I can`t afford both.
Hmm. I don`t know.
How much are they
The skirt`s  £28.50.
The trousers are a bit more expensive,
but not much.
Look. There`s Gary.
Where
There. He`s going into
the Men`s department.
Oh, I suppose he`s buying some new
clothes...
...for his interview with that
magazine.
Oh yes. What did he say
The readers of Stars and
Style magazine voted me...
...the best dressed newsreader on TV.
Let`s see what he`s buying.
Hi, Gary. What are you doing
I`m looking for a shirt and a tie
to go with my new suit.
Are they for your interview
Oh, do you know about that
Oh, come on, Gary.
Everybody knows.
You mention it at least
ten times a day.
Excuse me. Can I try these on, please
Sure. The changing rooms
are over there.
Thank you.
How many shirts are you taking
Only the best is good enough for
the best-dressed newsreader.
Hi, Tim.
OK, Gary. What`s in the bags
Oh, these It`s my new suit
and things for my interview...
...about the best dressed newsreader.
Yes, we know. Armani, eh
Bet that cost a bit.
Well, if it`s good,
the price doesn`t matter.
Did you hear that
Yes, he`s even worse than usual.
Somebody should do
something about him.
When is this interview anyway
Straight after the six o`clock news.
Psst! Sean! Sean!
Gary Fenton to the studio, please.
Five minutes.
Oh, there you are, Gary.
Why are you so late
Good evening.
This is Gary Fenton
with the six o`clock news.
Gary, your visitors.
Charlotte Mortimer from
Stars and Style magazine.
Pleased to meet you, Mr Fenton,
or may I call you Gary
Of course.
Now, can we take
some photographs first
Oh no. We always see you
at your desk, Gary.
Well, I feel more comfortable here.
But I`m sure all our readers want
to know if you`ve got any legs.
I`d really prefer to be at my desk.
Come on now, Gary.
Don`t be shy!
All right!
What are you wearing
Er, well, perhaps at the desk is better.
What`s happening
The reporter`s interviewing Gary.
And Gary always enjoys interviews.
Well, he isn`t enjoying this one.
I think we should give
his trousers back now.
Why
Oh, all right.
So when did you start doing that
A couple of years ago.
Sorry to interrupt.
We found these, Gary.
Excuse me.
Photograph
Come on, Gary. Cheer up.
The magazine got photos of you
in your new suit in the end.
But you looked so funny in
those baggy old trousers.
Where did you get them, anyway
They were Sean`s.
Oh no, Sean!
So what are we going to do
at this school
Tim`s going to interview one
of the teachers.
She`s won the lottery twice.
I`ve never won the lottery.
In fact, I`ve never won anything!
Is everything OK
Sure. Let`s go. Oh!
Tim! Are you all right
Yes, I`m fine. I`ve just got
stomach-ache, that`s all.
You can`t work like this.
You should be at home in bed.
Look. I`ve never missed
a day`s work in my life...
...and I`m not going to start now.
Anyway, who`s going to do
the interview if I`m not there
Me.
Have you ever done
an interview before
No, I haven`t, but I`ve watched you
several times and Sean`s here.
He`s filmed hundreds of interviews.
No, it`s OK, I can... Ow, ah!
Give me your car keys.
I`m going to take
you straight to the doctor.
Hi, how are you
Hi, Julia. Did you get the
interview all right
Yes, everything was fine.
But what about you
I feel a bit sore.
They took my appendix out
yesterday afternoon.
I know. I came to see you,
but you were asleep.
I was with Rebecca.
Uh-huh. I`ve never been
in hospital before.
How long are you going to be in here
I can go home tomorrow
and the doctor says...
...I can go back to work next week,
if I want to.
Tim. Don`t you ever stop
Hi, Gary.
Tim... Oh, hello, Julia.
Appendicitis, eh Ah no, I suppose
you can`t eat anything at the moment.
- Julia
- No thanks.
I`ve had appendicitis, you know.
Have you, Julia
Very painful. Now when did I have it
Oh yes. I was at school.
It must be oh, twenty years ago.
Hello Tim. What did the doctor say
All clear. And the best thing is
I can eat normally again.
Good.
Er, Julia...
... I, em, wanted to say
thank you for all your help when...
...you know... and well, erm...
...would you like to go out for a meal
sometime...
...just to, you know, say thank you
Yes, I`d love to.
Shall we try that new Italian place near
the museum
Mmm. That would be nice. When
Is this evening any good for you
Yes, it`s fine.
Great. Shall I call for you about eight

So can we meet at the restaurant
at say half past seven
OK.
