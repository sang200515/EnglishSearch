have you been great i've got a new job

really what is it oh just some freelance

writing for a website do you like doing

it yeah it's great because i can work

when i have time i bet you don't have

too much of that you are so right having

a toddler and a newborn is nuts do you

get any sleep at all you know what i

actually do that's lucky i didn't sleep

at all when my daughter was a baby

so tell me how are things back home

everything is mostly the same but there

must be some juicy gossip you can tell

me let me think i know you've been

hanging out with sharon she always knows

what's going on ah

you wouldn't guess who's getting married

who molly and steve oh that's surprising

i didn't even know they were dating yeah

for a few years now that's funny because

i remember them hating each other they

did seem to hate each other but i guess

love is fickle

are you still trying to learn spanish

yeah i have friends who live in

argentina and i want to go visit are you

taking classes or studying online i

would like to take classes but i can't

seem to find the time have you found any

good online tutorials then yeah there

are a few programs that i've checked out

you should probably find someone to

practice with i have heard of a group

that meets at a bar to practice on

wednesdays that sounds like fun i'd like

to go to that do you speak any spanish

yeah a little and i'd love to practice

what i know all right let's go together

this wednesday

do you have any pets i have two cats you

i really want a cat but i live with my

mom and she hates them oh that's a shame

i love my kitties yeah she says a cat

would drive her crazy i think she used

to have one what happened to it i'm not

sure it might have run away oh that's so

sad i don't know what i would do if one

of my cats ran away yeah i think she

never got over it well

maybe you could have another kind of

animal one that doesn't run away maybe i

should get a tortoise see that's a great

idea

how is the construction of your new

beach house coming really good it's

almost ready that's great what still

needs to be finished mostly the details

like painting the interiors that's

amazing have you done much work on it

yourself yeah i did a lot of the design

and logistics not so much the actual

building how cool to be able to design

your own house

yeah it's a lot of work but it will be

worth it in the end will you have a

guest room so i can come stay of course

it'd be great if you came and stayed for

a weekend all right let me know when

it's ready will do

how is your vegetable garden it's a lot

of work but i've been eating lots of

delicious fresh vegetables that's so

cool what have you been growing

well the cucumbers did really well this

year really how many did you grow

i had so many i couldn't even eat them

all i gave pounds and pounds away wow

what else do you grow well i've got corn

peppers and squash too how delicious

what's the hardest part about growing

vegetables it depends on the season but

keeping pests like ants out is really

hard i bet i would love to learn more

about growing my own food i'd be happy

to teach you

how are your kids doing great

they're growing so fast how are yours

good also but my three-year-old has been

sick this week oh i'm sorry to hear that

what's she got pretty bad cough and

she's been getting fevers at night oh

that's awful yeah the worst of it is

that she really wants to go to school oh

i bet she misses her little friends

exactly she's totally sick of being home

i hope she gets better soon i'm sure she

will it's just been hard entertaining

her all day i just let her watch tv all

day

can you believe this weather i know it's

wild it's been so windy these past few

days

yeah i'm worried about my roof blowing

off same here we just had it redone last

year so i'm hoping it'll be okay is it

supposed to rain soon

i just checked and it doesn't look like

it well

is the sun going to be out those days

nope looks like almost a week of cloudy

windy weather

okay well

i guess i'll be inside drinking hot

chocolate then oh that sounds so good i

like marshmallows in mine no not me i

think they're

gross what are you thinking about

cooking for dinner i'm not sure do you

have any ideas

well i'm thinking about lasagna but it's

a bit of a production that's true

what do you like to put in your lasagna

i like to use spinach and feta cheese

that sounds delicious

it is but it takes time to cook the

noodles make the spinach and the sauce

layer it all

yeah

and finally put it in the oven to cook

for at least 30 minutes but i'm sure

it's worth it in the end it absolutely

is i love eating it with a nice glass of

red wine i prefer white wine

have you seen any good movies lately

i've been pretty busy what about you

i saw a pretty good movie the other day

oh yeah what was it called the dead

don't die what was it about

a zombie apocalypse oh no those movies

are far too scary for me i love zombie

movies this one was pretty funny

actually i'll take your word for it and

stick to comedies what's your favorite

funny movie

i love groundhog day

what's your favorite tv show i think

friends is definitely my favorite show

oh i love friends it really takes me

back to the 90s yeah i love re-watching

the show it's so funny it really is who

is your favorite character

i think chandler's the funniest but you

gotta love joey how you doing

nice so did ross cheat on rachel no they

were on a break i disagree he totally

cheated that is so unfair they were

clearly on a break

poor rachel how could you even say that

this summer

yeah but i can't make up my mind where

to go what about you

oh we always go to the same place every

year where's that

my family's lake house that sounds nice

it is i've been going there since i was

a kid and i love taking my own kids

a lake for our vacation i totally

recommend it i'll look into it

too

who will you get to paint the house i'm

hoping my husband will help me do it

that's a lot of work it is but we enjoy

working on our house i like doing

projects around the house but painting

is a whole other story yeah i guess it

is but it's hard to find people you

trust to work on your house i know a

great guy i'll give you his number
