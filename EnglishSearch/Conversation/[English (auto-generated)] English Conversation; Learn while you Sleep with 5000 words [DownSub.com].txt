afraid of your answer

just ask me the question okay okay here

will you marry me of course hey i'm

really hungry

oh me too should we go to the kitchen

and cook something

sure let's go see what's in the fridge i

went shopping yesterday

so there should be plenty of food great

let's make some spaghetti

okay i'll get the pasta out of the

cupboard i'll get some vegetables from

the fridge

and i'll get the pasta sauce from the

cupboard oh and please grab a pot and a

pan

from under the counter great would you

get a knife from the drawer and chop the

vegetables

yeah oh and can you get some olive oil

from the cupboard

yes okay let's get cooking

good morning good morning would you turn

the alarm off

yeah and i'll open the curtains thanks

oh it's a beautiful day

it really is how did you sleep pretty

good

but i think we may need a new mattress

really

do you think it's gotten lumpy yeah my

back has been hurting lately

hmm mine too should we go to the

mattress store today

let's do it i'll get our clothes from

the closet

hello are you in there yeah i'll just be

one more minute

okay but i really need to take a shower

all right

i'm just brushing my teeth okay i'll

wait all right i'm done

it's all yours thanks wait where did you

put the towels

they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and

do you know if we have new shampoo

no but there's a little bit left in the

bottle thanks

okay i have to hurry i have to get to

work me too

see you tonight hey do you want to watch

some tv

yeah but i think we should move the tv

to that wall over there

why we'd have to move the couch too yeah

i know

but i just think it would look better

over there all right but we have to move

the coffee table too

okay let's put the couch over on that

side of the room

and we can put the coffee table right

here hmm

and what about the bookshelf i know we

can put it on that wall

okay i like it there now ready to watch

tv

after all that i'm pretty tired but

let's watch one show

great let's watch friends i think we

should have a dinner party

that's a great idea we could have about

eight people

yeah i think they'd all fit at the table

i think the table fits six

but we can add an extension to it okay

and maybe we should change the lighting

in the dining room yeah maybe we should

buy some new lamps for the corners of

the room

and do you think the tablecloth we have

looks nice still

i think so but i could pick up a new one

tomorrow we should think about the food

should we hire a catering company that's

a really good idea

how about mediterranean food perfect my

friend anne has a company

i'll ask her if she's free sounds good

i think we should redecorate this

basement really what do you want to use

it for

well i was thinking about turning it

into an artist studio that's a nice idea

are you thinking of painting again yeah

and there's all this room down here

now that we're down here do you think we

need a new water heater

yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after

we've redone it all right

i'll look into that first great and i'll

start thinking about the design for the

studio

i think i could teach classes down here

too that's a nice idea

yeah i was thinking about giving art

classes to the neighborhood kids

i'm sure they'd love that we have got to

clean out this garage

i know the car doesn't even fit anymore

since when did we get so much stuff

i don't know like these skis when was

the last time we used these

maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow

i forgot all about that we should have a

garage sale

that's such a good idea we can make some

money and clear this place out

exactly should we do it on saturday yeah

i'll go print out some flyers i really

think we need new desks in here

yeah we do so much work in here that

it'd be worth it okay let's go shopping

later this week

great okay i really need to get some

work done now

all right i'll just sit on the couch

here okay

you know now that i look into it the

study could use a new couch too

you're right okay i'll let you get to

work okay thanks

do you mind plugging my laptop in sure

thanks

and have you seen my cell phone yeah

it's on this shelf here

i'll get it for you thanks i

love how much sun we get out here on the

porch

oh me too you know what would be nice

what a porch swing

yes and i think we could use a few more

plants out here

you're right maybe some more flowers

yeah and i was thinking we could plant

some tomatoes

too i love that idea i'll go to the

hardware store this afternoon

and see if they have seeds great this

attic is so

creepy yeah we haven't been up here in

forever

there are so many cobwebs yeah i think

that might be a squirrel's nest over

there

oh wow do you think there are ghosts

well maybe this is an old house yeah

i hear noises up here at night sometimes

don't you think that could be the

squirrels

yeah probably i think we should get this

place cleaned up so we can use it

yeah we can make a guest room up here

hey when was the last time we went on a

holiday gosh

i don't remember was it two years ago

when we went to the beach

i guess so i didn't realize so much time

had passed

i know so do you think it's time for

another trip

absolutely i think i can get two weeks

off work

same here i think i have some days saved

up great

all we have to do is make some plans

yeah why don't we sit down tonight and

talk about it

okay all right i'll look at some travel

sites today

so will i okay so i checked out some

holiday options

me too i think we should go to the

mountains i was thinking the same thing

yes we could do hiking and maybe go

somewhere with hot springs

i love that idea great me too so did you

find any hotels you liked

i actually did wonderful yeah i found a

place that has a spa

and is it really expensive i think we

can afford it

i'll call to make reservations tomorrow

hello

travel agency how can i help you yes i'm

looking to book a room for two weeks

when will you be visiting do you have

availability next month

yes we do the last two weeks are open

great i need one room for two people and

would you like twin beds or a queen size

bed

a queen sized all right and do you have

any other questions

yes is the use of the spa included yes

it is

that's great we can't wait to go were

you able to make a hotel reservation

yes we have a room for two weeks next

month that's great

we should book a flight i thought maybe

we should drive oh

i guess it's not too far it's about a

seven hour drive right

yeah and then we could save on renting a

car while we're there

that's very true we should get the car

tuned up before we go

that's a really good idea we don't want

any car trouble on the way

yeah i can get that done after work

tomorrow

thanks sure and will you get it washed

next week

yeah so we're leaving in three days i

know

i'm so excited me too have you thought

about what you're going to bring

not at all me neither okay let's think

we'll need hiking boots and swimsuits

for the pool

and we should bring bug spray yeah and

sunscreen don't forget about our water

bottles

yeah and clothes for cool weather right

okay

let's get packing is the car all packed

up

i think so did you bring the cell phone

chargers yeah

here's the one we can plug into the car

great because we'll need the gps to get

there

all right let's go wait i'm not sure if

i locked the back door

i'll check thanks the house is all

locked up great we should stop at the

gas station on the way out of town

yeah and we can pick up some snacks and

coffee there sounds good

according to the gps we're almost there

great

it says here that there's a beautiful

waterfall nearby

don't you want to go ahead and go to the

hotel well i think it'd be nice to

stretch our legs

how long is the hike it says it's only

15 minutes to the falls
