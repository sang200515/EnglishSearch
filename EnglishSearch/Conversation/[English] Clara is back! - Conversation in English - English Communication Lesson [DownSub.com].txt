I Know What You Did Last Summer

oh my God

how do you know that

it doesn't matter

the only important thing is 
that everyone will know it soon

unless you do exactly as I say

okay you've won

please don't tell anyone I'll do anything you want 
me to do what am I supposed to do I'll do anything  

please don't tell anyone about 
my secret very good so you got it

just act normal for now

otherwise Lisa or Sarah are still suspicious

you'll go to school normally tomorrow

no one finds out about our meeting

okay and what happens next then 
you'll continue to earn Lisa's Trust

I want you to go home to her

and bring me her journal

your real diary

why do you want her journal

it's none of your business

you'd better do your job

otherwise everyone will soon know your secret

what do you want

don't worry I'll do it

but I have one request what do you want

please don't hurt Lisa

she is a lovely girl

she only wants good things for 
everyone she doesn't deserve to be hurt

I can do what I want with Lisa

you'd better take care of yourself

in two weeks we'll finish everything

I don't understand that

I thought you had to leave school

no I don't have to

Mr Coons has said a good word for me

I'll be back in two weeks

okay that's enough for today

get some rest and then get to work

I want to see results tomorrow

you know what else happens

I don't want to betray Lisa

but I must keep my secret

hey Jonas is everything okay with you

you look kind of concerned

everything is fine with me

how are you doing

I'm doing great

now that Clara is gone

I can finally live a normal life again

ah yes I'm happy for you

lessons are about to start

good morning dear students remember 
we'll write our class work next week

today we are covering a very important topic

so listen carefully and ask questions

today's topic is very important for class work

so let's get started

oh man I didn't understand anything

Sarah really

I was hoping you understood everything

and you can explain it to me

I'm so sorry the topic today was really difficult

what are we doing now

we absolutely need a good grade in class work

I don't know

I may be able to help you

did you understand the topic Jonas

yes I already had this topic at my old 
school that is why it is very easy for me

awesome so can you explain it to us

of course I'd love to do that

thank you Jonas you're the best

shall we go to my place after school Sarah

Jonas can explain the new topic to us

I'd love to go with you but I can't

I have dance lessons

I can explain it to you Lisa

and then you explain it to Sarah

that would be perfect

do you have time to come see me after school

I didn't understand the topic today

but luckily I have Jonas as a friend

that sounds great good luck

Jonas come on let's go to my room

we can study there in peace and quiet

okay Lisa

you already know my room

just make yourself comfortable

I need to go downstairs for a minute

I forgot the pens

no problem Lisa I'll wait for you here

I need to find Lisa's Journal if 
I can't find it I've got a problem

where could it possibly be

maybe under the bed

no that would be too obvious

there's a book on the dresser

there it is there is Lisa's Journal

I'm so sorry Lisa

I don't want to do that

but I have no choice

all right let's get started Jonas

yes let's get started

thank you Jonas

I understand everything now

I'll explain it to Sarah tomorrow

I'd love to do that Lisa

can I invite you over for 
an ice cream as a thank you

that is not necessary

I also have to go home

I'm sure my dad is already worried

okay no problem

then we'll eat the ice cream when else

hi Jonas where have you been

hey Dad I was with Lisa for a minute 
we studied together for class work

very nice

your girlfriend is back

she's waiting for you in the living room

okay thanks Dad

hi Jonas

I hope you have something for me

I was at Lisa's house today

where is her journal

I haven't found it

excuse me are you serious

I've been looking for it everywhere

I just couldn't find it

all right you know what that means

is there something else I can do for you

what are you doing there Clara

I'm sending a message to everyone in our class

soon everyone will know your secret

wait please don't do that

I have Lisa's Journal

it is here

why didn't you give it to me right away

I wanted to protect Lisa

you can't protect them from what comes next

please don't do that Clara

after all we can all be friends

it is too late for that

I'll see you soon at school

well then let's see what's written here

Lisa's diary entry from last week

Clara is finally gone

I'm still in love with Marcus

Lisa still likes Marcus

she'll be surprised hahaha

I know Lisa's Secrets now

she doesn't have a chance anymore

today we're finally getting the classwork back

do you think you have a good grade

I think so

thanks to Jonas I understood everything

thanks again for the help

no problem Lisa

hi guys

Clara what are you doing here

I'm back

but I thought you had to drop out of school

no I was only suspended for two weeks

I'm back and I'm going to stay

look forward to the school year Lisa

I have lots of surprises for you

who is taking dance lessons 
a Lisa B Jonah see Sarah  

write a comment what are we supposed to do now

it was so nice without Clara

she's back now

I don't know

we may have to change schools

I don't want to go to the same school as Clara

what do you think Jonas

I have no idea

I just know that she's really mad

we must be careful

and look out for each other

yes you're right

we're stronger together

if we stick together Clara doesn't stand a chance

let's go in

lessons are about to start

you can go ahead guys

I still have to get my book out of my locker

okay I'll see you soon Lisa

what is going on here

my locker is empty

yesterday all my books were still in here

hey Lisa where are your books

what did you do Clara

where are my books

I need them to study

you know that

I don't know what you're talking about

I have nothing to do with it

how did you open my locker anyway

no one but me knows the combination for the lock

I'm going in now

we don't want Mr Coons to get angry

good morning dear students the class work was good

congratulations

you've all passed

now we can move on to the next topic

please open your books on page 148.

Lisa can you read out the text please

that is not possible Mr Coons

why is that not possible

I've forgotten my book

Lisa you've got to be more careful about 
your stuff you're not six years old anymore

all right let's get on with it

Clara can you read out the 
text please of course Mr Coons

I'd love to do that

very good they can count on you

what's up Lisa

why are you crying

my day was awful dad

what has happened

Clara is back

excuse me why is Clara back

I thought she had to drop out of school

I thought so too

but she was only suspended for two weeks

now it's back

and I think she stole my books

that's enough I'll talk to Mrs misk

yes hello mask here

hello Mrs mask

this is Mr Peter's Lisa's father

hello Mr Peters

what can I do for you

Lisa just got home

she told me that Clara is still in school

yes that is correct

how can that be

she broke into school

why wasn't she thrown out

we've punished Clara appropriately

I promise you that Mr Peters

what do you mean by that

don't you get any referrals 
for something like this

yes we actually gave her two referrals

in the beginning we wanted to throw them out

but she always behaved well before that

Mr Coons has also said a good word for them

that's why we gave her another chance

I understand so she has to go 
if she gets another reprimand

yes that is correct

all right thank you Mrs misk

what did Mrs mess say papa

the bad news is that Clara is staying in school

and what is the good news

Clara already has two references

if she gets another reprimand she must go forever

so I have to make sure she gets another reprimand

I should be able to do that

Lisa I need to make a confession to you

Clara came to my house a few days ago

she knows a dark secret about me

she threatened me

she said she'd tell everyone my secret

what did she want from you

I had to steal your journal and give it to her

I'm so sorry

I shouldn't have done that

actually I must be angry right now

but I don't have time for that

we need to get rid of Clara

that is much more important

do you have a plan

Clara has my diary

that's why she was able to open my locker

but she doesn't know that 
we're one step ahead of her

we need to trick Clara

it's our only chance

Lisa doesn't even know what's in store for her

I know all their secrets

I've already stolen your books

next I'm going to steal the 
other stuff from her locker

I'm sure there are a few more 
things that are important to her

hi Lisa what are you already doing here 
lessons don't start for another 30 minutes

I need to talk to you for a minute Mr Coons

of course Lisa what is going on

Clara isn't as nice as you think she is

she took my journal and stole my books

how do you know that

do you have proof

Clara will do it again

I'm sure of that

please come with me to my locker

then you can see it with your own eyes

I can't imagine that

Carla is such a lovely girl

she wouldn't do that

but after that it's over

I don't want to hear any more about your quarrel

this is Lisa's Locker

I'm going to open it and steal their stuff

she doesn't have a chance

Clara what are you doing here

uh Mr Coons I can explain that

is it true what Lisa said

it's not what it looks like

that's enough now Clara

Mrs mesk was already about to 
throw you out but I was against it

I wanted to give you another chance

that was a mistake

Lisa was right the whole time

and I didn't believe her

that is about to change

I'll give you a reprimand

then you have a total of three 
references that is the end

you must leave school

good luck at another school

but Mr Coons I'm going to change

I promise you

stop lying Clara

it's enough

I've given you plenty of chances

you're leaving now and right away

I'm so sorry Lisa

I should have believed you a long time ago

did it work Lisa

yes the plan worked

Clara is gone for real this time

Mr Coons gave her another reprimand

we did it

who did not pass the class work a no 
one B Lisa see Jonah write a comment
