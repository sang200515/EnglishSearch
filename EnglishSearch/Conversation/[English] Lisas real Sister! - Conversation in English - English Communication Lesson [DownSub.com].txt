I'm going to tell everyone the truth

please don't do that

get out of my life Clara

Dad we need to talk

of course Lisa what is going on

Lara isn't who you think she is

what do you mean by that

Laura isn't really my sister

she is a liar

I don't understand that

are you jealous of her again

no I'm not jealous

I'm trying to tell you that Lara is lying

her real name isn't even Lara

her real name is Clara

she was trying to steal my life

why can't you just accept them Lisa

why do you have to make up stories like this

she's already admitted it Dad

why don't you believe me

tell him the truth right away Clara

what do you say Lisa

tell him who you really are

I'm Lara your sister you know that

tell him the truth or I'll hit you

dad why is Lisa so angry with me

stop being so unfair to your sister

your under house arrest for a week

why am I in trouble now

she's the bad guy not me

okay Dad

hey Sarah you won't believe this

what's up Lisa

do you have a minute or am 
I bothering you right now

I've got time

tell me what's going on

Lara is a liar

I knew it

her real name isn't Lara at all

she isn't really my sister either

who is she then

she wants to steal my life

oh my gosh

yes and do you know what the worst part is

what is it

my dad doesn't believe me

he is always on Lara's side

he probably feels guilty

because he neglected your sister back then

yes that may be

what am I supposed to do now

she lives with me

have you tried talking to your mom yet

no that's a good idea though

she might believe you

you're right

I'm going to try and talk to her

all right

tell me how it went then

I'll do that

when are you going to Australia now

my parents have postponed the move

we're only leaving in two weeks

all right I'm going to talk to my mom now

I'll get back to you afterwards

okay Lisa a lot has happened

thanks for the help Sarah

I would love to do that

Mom I need to talk to you

it is very important

of course darling

what is there anyway

please promise me that you'll believe me

okay I promise

Lara is not my sister

I don't understand you

she is an imposter mom

now I understand why your father grounded you

why are you making it so difficult for us

you're going to have to accept your sister

why does no one believe me

Sarah it didn't work

your mom didn't believe you

no she's on Clara's side too

is there only one option then

what did you think of

we need to find your real sister

what do you mean by that

if we find the right Lara 
your parents must believe you

how are we supposed to find them

I know someone who can help us

okay super

I'll talk to him

all right so I'll see you at school tomorrow

yes that's right see you tomorrow Lisa

hey Sarah did you talk to the Spy

yes I have that

I've got good news

he found the right Lara

what really

but that was quick

yes he is a very good spy

where is Lara

she is also here in Munich

perfectly

but she goes to another school

let's go there

okay I'm in

so this is Lara's School

yes the Spy said that

how do we find them now

he showed me a picture of her

I'll recognize them

she's apparently in fourth grade

so we just need to find their classroom

yes that would be good

there are a few rooms up front

I think I see a sign

it says fourth grade

what are you two doing here

you're not in our class

excuse me we're looking for someone

who are you looking for

we're looking for Lara Peters

is there a Lara Peters in the class

yes I am

I need you to come along for a minute please Lara

it's a long story

I don't even know you

I'll explain everything to you along the way

can I go with them both Mrs Coons

yes you can Lara

but you must be back here in two hours

okay I'll be back in two hours

would you like to have an ice cream today Lara

yes that would be great mom

of course you get everything you want

what are you doing here

and who is your new girlfriend Lisa

that's the right Lara

no that can't be true

is that true Lara

she is wearing a wig and contact lenses

that's what Clara really looks like

we're so sorry Lisa

we didn't want it to be true

but you were right

hello I am Laura Peters

Lisa told me the story

we're so sorry Laura

we weren't here for you back then

my parents have already told me that I am adopted

would you like to be part of our family Lara

I still have to think about that

actually I already have two parents

but I would really like to have a sister

and a new best friend

of course I'm always here for you Lara

Thank you Lisa

what are you going to do now Lara

I don't know

my whole life was turned upside down today

let us know if there's anything we can do to help

I'll do that

I think I'll talk to my parents first

they might also want me to stay here for a while

yes that would be great

I would be happy to hear that

me too

I've never had a sister before

from now on you've got one

awesome I'm going now

I really need to talk to my parents

all right see you later Lara

we're really so sorry Lisa

we didn't believe you

even though you're our daughter

we should have listened to you

and I scolded you too

I wasn't a good mom

I'm really sorry darling

no problem mom and dad

you didn't mean it badly

I needed to open your eyes

you did that correctly

how did you find Laura anyway

I only managed to do that with Sarah's help

she knows a spy

he found Lara's school and sent us a photo

I was happy to help Lisa

what's next

I hope that Laura will join us

and would like to be part of our family

I hope so too

let's see what her parents have to say about it

hey Mom hey Dad I need to talk to you for a minute

of course Lara what can we do for you

I met my real parents today

you've done something

I met Mr and Mrs Peters

how did that happen

a girl came to our school

she said she was my sister

her name is Lisa

and then

she said she needed my help

so I went to see her

you just go into strangers houses

why are you doing that Laura

but Dad they're my real parents

what happened then

I met Mr and Mrs Peters

they want me to stay with them for a while

I can't believe it

they're not your real parents Lara

we're your parents

we raised you

we've taken care of you

they were never there for you

but Dad I want to spend time with my sister

you can do that

but not with her parents

the two have already done enough work

okay Dad

can you believe that Martha

the two simply come after 10 years

and want to spend time with Laura

it's really unbelievable

we should go to them

and tell them what we think

that is a good idea

they're going to hear something

who are you

and what are you doing in our house

am I here with Mr and Mrs Peters

yes that is correct

do we know each other

not yet but that's about to change

we're Lara's parents

she told us what happened

how dare you talk to our daughter like that

we only offered Laura to be a part of our family

if that's what she wants

that is unbelievable

especially after you've just given Laura away

we raised them

and we took care of them

we're their real parents not them

we only offered it to Laura

the decision is up to her

but we don't see it that way

they've already done enough

Laura won't be spending any time near you

is that clear

we'll see about that

hey Mom hey Dad

when will we finally see Lara again

can she stay here for the weekend

I'd love to

the main thing is that I 
don't have to see her parents

they're really funny

what happened then

Lara's parents don't like us

what does that mean for us

we probably won't see Laura anymore

sorry Lisa

but I want to see my sister

our hands are tied Lisa

hey Lara we've got a problem

hey Lisa yes our parents had a fight

what should we do now

I don't think we can do anything

let's just wait and see

maybe they'll calm down again

yes that would be great

then we can spend more time together

I wish that too

okay I'll get back to you in a few days

all right I'll see you soon

good morning Sarah

hey Lisa is everything okay with you

well my parents had a fight 
with Lara's parents yesterday

what has happened

Lara's parents are angry

they don't want Lara spending time with us

why is that

they think we're a bad influence on Lara

but that is not good

what about Lara

what do you mean

does she want to spend time with you

yes I think so

then we'll have to convince her parents

come on we'll fix it

Lisa Sarah what are you doing here

we'd like to talk to them Mr and Mrs Meyer

my parents told me about the fight

you have nothing to do with it Lisa

it's not your fault

I'm sorry you're getting involved in this

I'd really like to get to know Laura better

we're sisters after all

the problem isn't you it's your parents

they are not reliable

we can't trust them

but Lara also wants to spend time with us

how do you know that

I spoke to her

and what is your suggestion

Lara could stay with us over the weekend

just for one night

then we can get to know each other better

I'm not sure if that's a good idea

please give us a chance

you won't regret it

I promise

what do you think honey

if Laura really wants that I agree

okay we'll give it a try

but just for one night

thank you Mr and Mrs Meyer

all right we'll pick Laura up again 
tomorrow morning at nine o'clock

I'd love to

thank you for your trust Mr and Mrs Meyer

we're going to take good care of Lara

we promise you that

how long does Laura stay with Lisa a one night 
B two nights see one week write a comment
