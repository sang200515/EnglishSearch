  website

  i don't usually use websites to
  
  entertain
  
  could you recommend some of them for me

  if you want to watch films
  
  i suggest the website netflix.com
  
  oh i have known about it
  
  and if you want to update the news or
  
  information you can ask us some websites
  
  such as facebook.com or youtube
  
  oh
  
  they are very popular all over the world
  
  that's right they attract millions of
  
  monthly visits
  
  oh maybe because i don't pay much
  
  attention to these websites
  
  i think they can help you keep up with

  do you mean i shouldn't use them too

  i have heard a lot about this place but
  
  i still haven't had the chance to see it
  
  after visiting this place i'm really
  
  into some historical places
  
  i am also interested in them
  
  i find it interesting to know about the
  
  history and the symbol of these places

  i searched for information on the
  
  internet about some famous historical
  
  places

  decorating the room
  
  interior decoration is an extremely
  
  interesting topic in daily life
  
  everyone has a passion for decorating
  
  their own house
  
  let's watch the video to see
  
  conversations about interior decoration
  
  situation one decorate a new apartment
  
  [Music]
  
  sophia the new apartment will be
  
  available in a month i think it's time
  
  for us to discuss the interior design
  
  joe i was going to tell you these days i
  
  have been looking at many different
  
  designs online
  
  here are some styles i feel interested
  
  in
  
  okay show me what you've got
  
  so this is a modern style with kind of
  
  white plain walls a darker color tone
  
  for furniture
  
  and a lot of glasses and marble flooring
  
  [Music]
  
  to be honest it looks great i love
  
  simplicity however we plan to have a
  
  baby in the near future
  
  so do you think we should try something
  
  a little bit softer
  
  you were right
  
  how about this traditional style with a
  
  neutral color tone with floral patterns
  
  looks a bit old-fashioned to me
  
  you like this style don't you
  
  um
  
  not really i just like the cozy feeling
  
  so do i i prefer something that makes me
  
  feel at home
  
  any other options that are both modern
  
  and cozy
  
  yes this one
  
  what do you think it still looks simple
  
  and modern but a lot cozier with a
  
  warmer color
  
  light gray or brownie is trending this
  
  year
  
  i like this one especially the wooden
  
  flooring
  
  we can use it for bedrooms very
  
  affordable i want to have carpet in the
  
  living room
  
  all right how about the kitchen
  
  i want material that is easy to clean
  
  and waterproof
  
  right how about the color
  
  i'm into brown or beige colors like this
  
  one
  
  me too in short our taste is modern but
  
  cozy
  
  neutral brown beige tone
  
  then i think wooden furniture will be an
  
  excellent match
  
  sure i will note it down
  
  we will discuss a detailed design
  
  tomorrow okay
  
  yes i will do more research
  
  [Music]
  
  situation 2
  
  decorating the room for a baby girl
  
  [Music]
  
  hi anna how are you
  
  hi kate i'm great and you come in
  
  are you back from work just now
  
  i'm good and yes i haven't seen you for
  
  months too busy with the new job
  
  today i remember that you will be in
  
  labor in over a month so i tried to
  
  leave work early today to visit you
  
  so nice of you come and take a sit
  
  don't mind my messy place we are
  
  redecorating a bedroom for my little one
  
  oh really how is it going
  
  it must be the cutest room in the house
  
  we have just started recently
  
  how is your plan for the baby girls room
  
  we always like minimalism you know so
  
  the room style will match with other
  
  rooms also
  
  three walls are light brown and one wall
  
  is white the floor will be covered with
  
  beige carpet and a white fur rug
  
  nice that's very modern and cute at the
  
  same time what are there in the room i
  
  can see the crib over there
  
  i try to only put necessary kinds of
  
  stuff
  
  there will be a crib a medium-sized
  
  wardrobe for clothes and a small cabinet
  
  for things like diapers or little things
  
  for the baby all in white
  
  wait you mentioned one white wall before
  
  that right why only one
  
  good question
  
  i intended to put a huge wooden shelf
  
  that has the size of the whole wall
  
  what is it for
  
  for children's books and toys and for
  
  decorating purposes also
  
  i think books and toys are very colorful
  
  so they will be stand out on the white
  
  wall
  
  very unique idea
  
  my friends usually spend the wall on
  
  cute stickers
  
  i also decorate other walls with cute
  
  pictures of animals but also in a
  
  minimalism style
  
  ah i forgot to mention a chair that's
  
  all
  
  have you bought all those furniture
  
  yes i have
  
  not many though the only thing that
  
  takes time is painting in the big shelf
  
  sounds like a very lovely room remember
  
  to send me a photo when you finish the
  
  room
  
  sure i will
